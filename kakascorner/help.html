<h2>What should I do if I only received a partial shipment?</h2>
<p> It is possible your shipment was split based on product availability, and that the missing items will be shipped when they become available. Please contact us at 1-866-678-1770 from 9AM – 6PM EST Monday – Friday (except holidays) to report an incomplete shipment, and we will check the status of your missing items. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
</p>

<h2>Why are prices different now than when I made my purchase?</h2>
<p>All prices and availability of products are subject to change without notice, up until the order is completed and confirmed. We make every effort to provide you the most accurate information on pricing and availability. In addition, some of the items on our web site may be incorrectly priced or no longer available at the time you place your order.
</p>

<h2>Why is my credit card authorized for more than the purchase amount?</h2>
<p>During the credit approval/confirmation process, your credit card is not charged for your order. The pending transaction that you see is actually a pre-authorization charge. The final charge, where we will take the funds from your credit card, will happen once the item has shipped. If you have any further questions, please call us at 1-866-678-1770 from 9am – 6pm EST Monday – Friday (except holidays).</p><br><br><br><br><br>
